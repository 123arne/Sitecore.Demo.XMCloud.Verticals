        <div class="ck-content"><p><i>Please note that there are different country versions of this press release available (EN | FR | NL | PL |SE).</i><br /><i>Find them in the media set to download.</i></p><p>Festool's range of accessories offers everything needed for a perfect result for every routing application. The wide range of router bits hugely increases the possible range of applications. With the right accessories, routing of round and square cut-outs, rows of holes in furniture, finger joints or worktop panel joints will no longer present any kind of problem. The accessories are precisely matched to the routers. This speeds up work processes and produces high-quality results more quickly and precisely..</p><p><br /><strong>The templates with all the options</strong></p><p>Complex work processes to produce handmade templates or jigs often take a lot of time and cause a lot of stress until everything fits properly. With the MFS 400 and 700 multi-routing template, Festool has the perfect solution: Just set them once then route as many times as you need to. This means that cut-outs and circles can be created individually and with absolute precision, using the scale on the profile which is accurate to the millimetre. Integrated clamping options enable simple and precise fixing directly on the workpiece – via angle stops and prefabricated grooves for screw and lever clamps. Systematic expansion is possible with extensions from 200 to 2000 millimetres for rectangular and round cut-outs.</p><p><br /><strong>Worktop corner joints – problem solved</strong></p><p>Installing worktops and joining them with precision is common practice when installing kitchens. The APS 900/2 worktop routing template makes it easy to route and manufacture custom-fit joints for worktops at a 90° angle. The template can be permanently fixed to the integrated clamp and thus it enables precise results – even when the router passes several times along a single groove. With the new APS, worktops with a depth of 600 to 650 millimetres can be routed in a single set-up – with extension profiles, even over 900 millimetres. Commercially available connecting fittings can use two routing templates that can be freely positioned on the underside of the panels to make recesses. The routing template is made from aluminium and is therefore particularly durable. The anodised surface protects the template against the copying ring breaking through on the leading edge. Festool recommends the new APS 900/2 in conjunction with the OF 2200 or OF 1400 router with a reversible-blade groove cutter of 14 millimetres in diameter and a copying ring of 30 millimetres in diameter.</p><p><br /><strong>Practical accessories Systainers offer countless possibilities</strong></p><p>Festool has put together various accessories Systainers in which everything is neatly stowed away for specific applications and is always to hand when you need it. For example, precise rows of holes are a recurring theme when manufacturing furniture, as they are required for shelf supports, rear wall supports and fittings. The LR 32-SYS hole series drilling set Systainer contains all the accessories you need to produce these precise rows of holes. In conjunction with the OF 1010 or OF 1400 router and an FS 1400/2-LR 32 guide rail, precise rows of holes spaced 32 mm apart can be produced. With this LR 32-SYS Systainer, Festool offers an optimum, mobile solution. Everything is organised and ready to hand in a Systainer: Guide plate, centring mandrel, HW hinge location cutter with 35 mm diameter, HW dowel drill with 5 mm diameter (V-shaped tip), HW dowel drill with 5 mm diameter (with centre point and pre-cutter), two parallel side fences with adjustable stop, FSZ 120 fastening clamps and two longitudinal stops. Corresponding LR guide rails are available in two lengths of 1400 or 2424 millimetres.</p><p><br />The ZS-OF 1010 M accessories set Systainer for the OF 1010 router is also very practical. It contains a number of aids for milling applications: Guide rail adapter, centring mandrel, copying rings, trammel unit, base runners and much more. Everything is neatly stowed away and always ready to hand. Additional slots offer the best protection for existing router bits. The ZS-OF 2200 accessories set Systainer is the perfect addition to the OF 2200 router. With different base runners, a parallel side fence, a guide stop for the guide rail and a range of copying rings. It ensures you are equipped for every possible application with the OF 2200. Everything cleanly and compactly packed in the Systainer³.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Router bit box – router bits for any task</strong></p><p>The router bit box (Box-OF HW S8 Mix) is used to safely store ten different carbide-tipped router bits with an eight millimetre shank. The router bits can be used for a wide range of applications, such as profiling, grooving and rounding of edges, etc. The box is perfect for construction sites and workshops, as the router bits are safely and clearly organised and can be easily and conveniently removed from the box. The box consists of an edge trimming cutter, a dowel drill, two groove cutters with drill points, three roundover cutters, a chamfer cutter, a disc groove cutter and a dovetail cutter.</p><p><br /><strong>LED light ring for the OF 1010</strong></p><p>Another clever new addition to the range of accessories for the OF 1010 REBQ (from production month 09/2021) is the LED light ring. It is easy to retrofit and provides shadow-free lighting from all sides in two brightness levels. The light ring is directly integrated into the base plate and is therefore close to the workpiece. Simply insert the light ring and click in the battery unit. The light remains fitted on the router and the battery unit can be removed as required. Thanks to the integrated USB-C interface, it can be easily recharged and offers up to six hours of light.</p><p><br /><strong>Perfect results require the right accessories</strong></p><p>"Festool develops not only power tools but also over 1700 accessories in a comprehensive system that helps our customers get ahead. After all, a power tool is only as good as the accessories it is being used with. We value precision and quality, efficiency and reliability.
